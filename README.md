# Proportional-Derivative Neural Networks

This is the code for our paper, [Temporally Efficient Deep Learning with Spikes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04159).


To install (on OSX, Linux) go:

```
git clone https://github.com/petered/pdnn.git
cd pdnn
source setup.sh
```

After setup is complete, you should be able to run:

```
python pdnn/figures.py
```

To generate any of the figures from our paper.

If you have any questions about this code, feel free to contact Peter at <a href='&#109;ai&#108;t&#111;&#58;pe%&#55;4er%2&#69;ed&#46;&#111;co%6E&#110;%6Fr&#64;&#103;%6Dai&#108;&#46;com'>&#112;ete&#114;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#46;oco&#110;&#110;&#111;r&#64;gma&#105;l&#46;&#99;o&#109;</a>
